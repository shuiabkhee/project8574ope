New configuration
Configurations are similar to secrets, but should only be used for non-sensitive information. They're useful for having a variable that's different between your published app and when testing on Replit.

User: telegram privy login sholwiung this:  https://oauth.telegram.org/auth?bot_id=8591372909&origin=https%3A%2F%2Fvigilant-disco-wrqw6v4q4ggjc557-5000.app.github.dev&request_access=true&return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fvigilant-disco-wrqw6v4q4ggjc557-5000.app.github.dev%2Fevents   Bot domain invalid

GitHub Copilot: I'll add a short todo plan listing the steps to fix the "Bot domain invalid" error.

Created 5 todos

Cause: Telegram OAuth requires the bot's allowed domain to match the request origin host. "Bot domain invalid" means the host in your `origin`/`return_to` (vigilant-disco-wrqw6v4q4ggjc557-5000.app.github.dev) isn't registered for your bot.

Quick fix (steps you can do now)
- Open Telegram and chat with @BotFather.
- Use the /setdomain command or: My Bots → select your bot → Bot Settings → Domain.
- Enter the host only (no protocol, no port): vigilant-disco-wrqw6v4q4ggjc557-5000.app.github.dev
- Save. Then retry your URL (ensure `origin` and `return_to` use the same host).

Notes and alternatives
- Do NOT include `https://` or `:5000` when setting domain — only the hostname.
- If the .app.github.dev host is ephemeral or blocked, run an exposed URL (ngrok) and register that host instead:
  - Run: 
    ```bash
    ngrok http 5000
    ```
  - Register the ngrok host (e.g. aa1b2c.ngrok.io) in BotFather and update `origin`/`return_to`.
- Make sure `return_to` is URL-encoded and uses the same host+scheme you registered.

If you want, I can:
- Walk through the exact BotFather steps with screenshots,
- Help expose your dev server with ngrok and update the link,
- Or update any app link files in the repo. Which would you like next?

User: give me the admin link


GitHub Copilot: Do you mean the BotFather admin page or the OAuth link used for login?

- Bot management (BotFather): https://t.me/BotFather — use `/mybots` → select your bot → Bot Settings.  
- OAuth URL you posted: https://oauth.telegram.org/auth?bot_id=8591372909&origin=https%3A%2F%2Fvigilant-disco-wrqw6v4q4ggjc557-5000.app.github.dev&request_access=true&return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fvigilant-disco-wrqw6v4q4ggjc557-5000.app.github.dev%2Fevents

Which one did you want?

User: platform admin link, not the bot

GitHub Copilot: Do you mean Telegram's platform admin site? If so use: https://my.telegram.org

If you meant a different platform (your app's admin panel or the OAuth dashboard), tell me which and I’ll give the exact link.

User: this website admin panel link and seeded login

GitHub Copilot: I'll add a short plan, then search the repo for seed/admin credentials and admin routes.

Updated todo list

Now I'll search the repository for likely credential and admin-related keywords.

Searched for regex `admin|seed|ADMIN_PASSWORD|ADMIN_EMAIL|createAdmin|seedAdmin|superadmin|DEFAULT_ADMIN|seeder|seedUsers|admin@example|root@example`, 20 results

Listing routes to find admin route files.

Read [](file:///workspaces/glshb4848/server/routes)

Read [](file:///workspaces/glshb4848/server/routes/adminNotificationsApi.ts)

Searching for files that create users or set `isAdmin`.

Searched for regex `isAdmin|admin@example|DEFAULT_ADMIN|createUser|insert into users|seed user|seeder|initial admin|admin@|superadmin`, 20 results

Opening the log file that mentioned a backup admin user to extract the seeded admin credentials.

Read [](file:///workspaces/glshb4848/attached_assets/Pasted--rest-express-1-0-0-dev-2025-12-10T17-30-48-881-INFO-Ru_1765387872945.txt#350-350), lines 350 to 412

Updating the todo list to mark search and file review completed.

Starting: *Report admin panel URL and seeded login* (3/3)

Admin panel URL:
- https://vigilant-disco-wrqw6v4q4ggjc557-5000.app.github.dev/admin/login

Seeded admin logins (from repo logs):
- Username: admin — Password: admin123
- Backup: Username: superadmin — Password: admin123

Notes:
- You can override the password with the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env var if the app supports it.
- Let me know if you want me to log in, change the password, or update the OAuth origins/domains.

User: admin panel seems to not be listing users, even though there are some few users on the platforms
