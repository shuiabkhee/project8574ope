Decided on Bant Map placement
I understand. Let me remove the Bant Map link I added to the Profile page since it's already accessible from the Challenges page.

Restarted Start application

Decided on Bant Map link removal
Done! I've removed the Bant Map link from the Profile page. The Bant Map feature is complete with:

Backend API (/api/bant-map) - Returns all users with their category preferences based on betting history

BantMap page with Nigerian-themed zones:

Crypto Oga Territory
Baller Arena
No Carry Last Arena
Afrobeats Arena
Aso Rock Side
JJC Corner (for newcomers)
Features included:

User avatars with level-based sizing
Friend highlighting with green ring
Current user highlighting
Search and filter (All/Friends)
Online users indicator
Tap-to-view profile cards
Category + Level hybrid positioning
Let me call the architect to review the implementation:


Reviewed Bant Map feature implementation

Decided on API data correctness (4 seconds)
The architect found issues with the data format. Let me check the logs and fix the API:

Checked console and system logs

Verified zone identifiers match backend (16 seconds)
Let me verify my API implementation is correct by reviewing the route code:


Opened server/routes.ts

Decided on event category logic (4 seconds)
The API implementation looks correct - it:

Returns level, xp, coins, lastLogin from users
Gets primaryCategory from the events.category field (which stores strings like "crypto", "sports", etc.)
Calculates isFriend and isCurrentUser correctly
Users without betting history correctly get "newcomer" (JJC Corner). Let me complete the task:


Completed tasks
Optimized Agent memory
