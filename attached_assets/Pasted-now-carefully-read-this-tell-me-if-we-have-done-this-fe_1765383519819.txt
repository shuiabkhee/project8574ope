Executed rg -i -l '/api/og|dynamic.*image|satori|puppeteer' .

Assessed existing social sharing implementation
Good news - it looks like we have some implementation already. Let me check what's in place:

Opened server/og-meta.ts

Assessed implementation against document
Based on my review, we have MOST of this feature implemented, but there are some gaps. Here's the assessment:

✅ What's Already Implemented:
SocialMediaShare Component - Full share dialog with:

Twitter/X, Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram, Instagram, TikTok buttons
Native Web Share API support
Copy link functionality
FOMO-style share text messages
OG Image Generator (/api/og/challenge/:id, /api/og/event/:id)

Dynamic SVG images for challenges and events
Shows challenger vs challenged, stake amount, category, status
OG Meta Tags (server/og-meta.ts)

Dynamic metadata for challenges, events, profiles, referrals
Twitter Card support (summary_large_image)
Facebook Open Graph tags
Sharing Utilities (client/src/utils/sharing.ts)

Platform-specific share URLs
Challenge, event, profile, referral sharing functions
⚠️ What Needs Improvement/Fixing:
OG Meta tags may not be SSR-rendered - For social platforms to properly scrape the OG tags, they need to be rendered server-side in the HTML response (not client-side)

LSP Errors - The ogImageGenerator.ts and og-meta.ts have TypeScript errors that need fixing

Branding inconsistency - Some places say "BetChat" instead of "Bantah"

Would you like me to:

Fix the existing implementation - Resolve TypeScript errors and ensure OG tags work properly
Check if SSR OG tags are working - Verify the challenge/event pages serve proper meta tags for social scrapers
Update branding to consistently use "Bantah"
