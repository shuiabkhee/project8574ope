ChatGPT said:

Here is the cleanest, most practical, professional breakdown of how to implement social media Challenge Invitations for your app — across WhatsApp, Telegram, Twitter/X, Snapchat, Instagram, Discord, SMS, and Phone Contacts — using smart OG Meta Cards, deep links, and dynamic challenge URLs.

This is EXACTLY what modern viral apps (Friend.tech, Polymarket, Bolt, Snapchat, Nostra, etc.) use to grow.

⭐ 1. THE CORE IDEA

Every challenge must produce a unique, shareable, auto-rendering link:

Example:
bantah.fun/challenge/7Ax923


When shared anywhere, it should automatically show a Preview Card (OG Meta) such as:

Category (e.g. Football – Chelsea vs Arsenal)

User who initiated the challenge

Stake amount

YES or NO selected

Timer countdown

CTA: “Accept Challenge Now”

This turns every challenge into a viral asset.

⭐ 2. OG META CARD TECHNOLOGY (CRITICAL FOR VIRALITY)

Your challenge URL must include dynamic Open Graph (OG) tags so when pasted on any platform, it generates a rich preview.

Example OG tags:
<meta property="og:title" content="🔥 Accept My Challenge on Bantah!" />
<meta property="og:description" content="I just staked ₦5,000 on 'Wizkid Drops Album Before May 20'. Can you beat me? FCFS pairing." />
<meta property="og:image" content="https://bantah.fun/api/og/challenge/7Ax923.png" />
<meta property="og:url" content="https://bantah.fun/challenge/7Ax923" />
<meta property="og:type" content="website" />
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" />


The og:image should be generated dynamically using a backend function.

This is exactly how:

Polymarket

YouTube

Spotify

TikTok

Binance

Bolt

generate rich link previews.

⭐ 3. DYNAMIC OG IMAGE GENERATOR

You need a backend endpoint that produces a challenge-specific image.

Example:
GET /api/og/challenge/:id


It should render:

User avatar (optional)

Challenge title

Stake amount

YES/NO

Time left

Platform branding

This is the card image shown on WhatsApp, Twitter, Discord, Telegram.

Tools you can use:

Vercel OG Image

Puppeteer

Satori (React → PNG)

HTML → screenshot

This is the engine of virality.

⭐ 4. UNIVERSAL SHARE BUTTON (Inside the Challenge Page)

Every challenge card inside your app must have a Share Challenge button.

Tapping it opens a menu:

Platforms:

WhatsApp

SMS

Contacts

Telegram

Twitter/X

Discord

Instagram Story

Snapchat

Copy Link

QR Code (optional)

⭐ 5. PLATFORM-SPECIFIC BEHAVIOR
🔹 WHATSAPP

Use:

https://wa.me/?text=YOUR_TEXT_HERE


Your text should include:

I challenge you on Bantah! Stake: ₦5,000
YES/NO: YES
Event: ‘Wizkid drops album by Friday’
Accept before timer ends 🔥
https://bantah.fun/challenge/7Ax923


WhatsApp instantly pulls the OG Meta Card → 🔥 HIGH FOMO.

🔹 TWITTER / X

Use intent tweet URLs:

https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=YOUR_TEXT&url=YOUR_URL


People tweet their challenge publicly → viral effects.

Example prefilled tweet:

💥 I just issued a challenge on Bantah
Stake: ₦5,000 — YES side
Can you beat me? FCFS

Join: https://bantah.fun/challenge/7Ax923


The OG meta card makes it look professional and clickable.

🔹 TELEGRAM

Works instantly with OG cards.

You can generate:

tg://msg_url


But simplest is:

User pastes the challenge link → Telegram pulls your OG image beautifully.

🔹 DISCORD

Same as Telegram — Discord automatically shows rich embed previews if OG tags are correct.

🔹 INSTAGRAM STORY (IMPORTANT)

You cannot auto-share text → but you can auto-generate a PNG poster of the challenge.

User can:

share it to Story

Story includes your link manually

Sticker CTA link

🔹 SNAPCHAT

Same method as Instagram Story.

Also supports link cards.

🔹 PHONE CONTACTS / Device Contacts

Use native share sheet:

iOS:
navigator.share()
Android:
Intent.ACTION_SEND

Auto-open device sharing to:

SMS

Contacts

Email

WhatsApp

Snapchat

Telegram

Perfect for your “Challenge Contacts” tab.

⭐ 6. CHALLENGE MESSAGE TEMPLATE

When sharing, use this short FOMO message:

I’m calling you out on Bantah! ⚔️🔥
Event: {{event_title}}
My Pick: {{yes_or_no}}
Stake: ₦{{amount}}
Accept my challenge before someone else takes it (FCFS)

👉 https://bantah.fun/challenge/{{id}}


Works for ALL platforms.

⭐ 7. OPTIONAL: AUTO-GENERATED VIDEO PREVIEW

A 3–5 second animated card:

Yes/No flipping animation

Countdown timer

Stake highlight

“Tap to Accept”

This massively boosts click-through.

⭐ 8. OPTIONAL: SOCIAL ACCOUNT LINKING

For deeper integration, let users link:

Twitter

Discord

Telegram

TikTok

Instagram

Then auto-post wins & challenges.

⭐ 9. OPTIONAL: LEADERBOARD-DRIVEN SOCIAL PROOF

Whenever a user shares a challenge:

their avatar flashes on map

challenge appears on global feed

feeds into the challenge heat map

Creates massive engagement loops.

⭐ FINAL RESULT

With this system:

🔥 Every challenge becomes a shareable viral asset
🔥 Every link generates FOMO
🔥 Users promote your app on WhatsApp, Twitter, Telegram
🔥 OG Meta Cards make it look professional and addictive
🔥 Your challenge network spreads like wildfire

This is exactly how Bolt, Polymarket, Friend.tech, and Snapchat Maps grow virally — but adapted for P2P betting.

If you want, I can now design:

✔ The full OG Meta card design
✔ The share sheet UI for your app
✔ The exact backend endpoints
✔ The FOMO message templates for all platforms
✔ The dynamic OG image generator structure
✔ The flowchart for challenge invitation system

what happens if a users accpets a challnge through the card on telegram, twitter, whatsapp, etc ?
ChatGPT said:

Great question — this is one of the MOST important parts of the whole viral system.
Here’s EXACTLY what happens behind the scenes when a user accepts a challenge from a shared OG card on Telegram, Twitter, WhatsApp, Discord, etc.

I’ll break it down simply and professionally.

⭐ WHEN A USER CLICKS THE SHARED CHALLENGE CARD

No matter the platform — Telegram, WhatsApp, Twitter/X, Discord, SMS — the flow is the same:

⭐ STEP 1 — Deep Link Opens

The link opens:

https://bantah.fun/challenge/7Ax923


This is the challenge page, directly tied to that unique challenge.

⭐ STEP 2 — Your Backend Reads the Challenge ID

The system fetches all details:

Event title

Category

Creator

Creator's side (YES or NO)

Stake amount

Time remaining

Whether the challenge is still open

The rules

The current pool

The status (waiting / paired / closed)

⭐ STEP 3 — USER STATE DETECTION

The backend checks:

✔ Is the visitor logged in?
✔ Is this their first time ever?
✔ Are they using mobile or desktop?
✔ Are they the creator of the challenge?

This determines the path.

⭐ STEP 4 — IF NEW USER

If the user is not logged in:

You show a step-by-step onboarding modal:
1. “You’ve been challenged!”
Show challenge preview  

2. “Sign in to accept the challenge”
- Phone number  
- Social login (Twitter, TikTok, Facebook, Email, Telegram login)  

3. After login → Auto-redirect back to challenge.

This is how you convert your virality into new users.

⭐ STEP 5 — IF EXISTING USER

They see:

A clear CTA button:

🔥 “ACCEPT CHALLENGE — ₦5,000”

(or the stake written)

Before they accept, you show:

Stake required (₦5,000)

Their selected side (opposite of the creator)

Time left

What happens if they win

⭐ STEP 6 — USER ACCEPTS THE CHALLENGE

When they click Accept:

🔥 1. They choose their YES/NO (must be opposite of creator)
🔥 2. They confirm stake
🔥 3. Payment screen opens (Flutterwave / Paystack / Crypto for USDT/BTC)

Once paid:

Their stake is locked in ESCROW

The challenge becomes paired

The event pool is updated

The creator is notified

The user is notified

The challenge is no longer open to the public

⭐ STEP 7 — POST-ACCEPT FLOW

After acceptance:

The user sees the Paired Challenge Screen:

Both users’ avatars

Their respective stakes

YES/NO chosen

Countdown timer

Rules

Payout amounts

Cancelation rules (if any)

Chat button (if you allow challenger-to-challenger chat)

⭐ STEP 8 — THE ORIGINAL CREATOR GETS A NOTIFICATION

If they are online or offline:

In-app push

SMS (optional)

Telegram bot (optional)

Email (optional)

Notification:

Someone accepted your challenge!
Stake: ₦5,000
Side: NO
Event: 'Will Wizkid drop an album before May 20?'

⭐ STEP 9 — EVENT RESOLUTION

When your oracle resolves:

Escrow releases to winner

Admin collects 3% fee

Result is pushed to both users

Win/loss history updated

Users can share win on social media
(very important for virality, I can design this too)

⭐ WHAT IF THE CHALLENGE IS ALREADY ACCEPTED?

If someone clicks the link but it's already paired:

They see:

❗ “This challenge has already been accepted.”

and then:

🔥 “Create your own challenge?”

or

🔥 “Join other open challenges now”

This recaptures the traffic and prevents losing potential users.

⭐ WHAT IF THEY CLICK THE LINK FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY?

You can:

Show local currency

Convert stake

Offer crypto-only acceptance

Or block depending on legal rules

(We can design this flow too)

⭐ WHAT IF THE CREATOR CANCELLED BEFORE ACCEPTANCE?

Then show:

This challenge is no longer available.


But offer alternative actions.
