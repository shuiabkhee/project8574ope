Since you already bonus the weak side (YES/NO imbalance), here are extra simple bonus layers you can add that are:

✔ Easy to understand
✔ Not complex like gambling odds
✔ Works for 1M-user public challenges
✔ Creates urgency, FOMO, and retention
✔ Makes Bantah feel like “earn for opinions” not “gambling app”

⸻

1. Early Opinion Bonus (FCFS – first come, first earn)

Model: Admin sets first X users per side to earn extra.

Example config:

Early YES bonus → first 2,000 users get +5%
Early NO bonus  → first 2,000 users get +5%

Hook effect:
 • Creates urgency
 • Converts observers to participants fast

Marketing copy examples:

“🔥 First 2,000 YES picks earn 5% extra!”
“Don’t just guess, earn for doing it early.”

⸻

2. Conviction Bonus (for staying till the end)

Model: Reward users who don’t exit/cancel their position.

Example:

Held YES/NO until resolution → +3% bonus on earnings

Hook effect:
 • Encourages confidence
 • Reduces drop-offs

Copy:

“Hold your YES/NO = earn more 💰”
“Opinions with patience pay better.”

⸻

3. Streak Booster Bonus (consistency pays)

Model: Reward consecutive correct predictions, not stake size.

Very simple ladder:

Streak Bonus
3 correct +2%
5 correct +5%
10 correct +10%

Hook effect:
 • Adds skill status
 • Keeps users coming back

Copy:

“5/5 streak? You earn 5% extra 🔥”
“Be consistent, get boosted.”

⸻

4. Friend-Challenge Bonus (social pairing booster)

Even though it auto-matches globally, you reward users for tagging friends into challenges.

Example:

Tag a friend + get matched → both get ₦20 bonus or +1%

Hook effect:
 • Drives virality
 • Makes arguing social + profitable

Copy:

“Challenge a friend. Both earn more.”
“Don’t just argue, monetize the rivalry.”

⸻

5. Admin-Sponsored Bonus Pool (featured challenge boost)

Admin injects a bonus pot that distributes to winners.

Example:

Admin bonus pool: ₦1,000,000
Split to winners only (pro-rata or random draw)

Displayed on card:

“💰 ₦1M Bonus Boosted Challenge!”

Hook effect:
 • Big spotlight
 • Non-bettors join for earnings, not risk

Copy:

“This challenge is boosted by Bantah Admin 🔥 ₦1M pool!”
“Your opinion could earn more than you think.”

⸻

6. Participation Bonus (for just joining the minority side)

Different from “weak matching bonus”, this rewards joining the side that ends up winning even if it was minority.

Example:

If < 25% of users picked YES and YES wins → +6% bonus

Hook effect:
 • Rewards boldness
 • Makes it feel like skill and bravery, not gambling

Copy:

“Pick boldly, earn differently.”
“Unpopular ≠ unprofitable.”

⸻

7. First-Time Opinion Bonus (safe entry for non-bettors)

Model: First ever YES/NO join gets boosted.

Example:

First challenge participation → +10% bonus

Hook effect:
 • Removes hesitation
 • Turns non-gamblers into users

Copy:

“Your first opinion earns extra. No pressure, just profit.”

⸻

8. Bonus stacking rule (keep it simple)

To avoid confusion:

Max 2–3 bonuses can apply per challenge, controlled by admin toggles.

Example stack:
 • Weak side bonus ✅
 • Early opinion bonus ✅
 • Streak bonus ❌ (disabled for this one)

⸻

Bonus strategy summary

Bonus type Triggers emotion Converts non-bettors?
Weak side Fairness Yes
Early Opinion Urgency Yes
Conviction Trust Yes
Streak Status No-risk model, yes
Friend challenge Social fun Yes
Admin pool Massive FOMO Yes
First-time Safety Yes


⸻

Key growth principle

Bonuses should reward behavior (early, bold, consistent, social), not confuse users with betting math.

This keeps Bantah a:
 • Money-making opinion app
 • Not a gambling odds app
 • Scalable to millions
 • Easy to market
