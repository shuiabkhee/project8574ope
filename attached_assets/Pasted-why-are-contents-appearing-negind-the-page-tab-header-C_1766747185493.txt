I see the issue now. The tab content is appearing behind the tab header. Let me fix the z-index and spacing to ensure proper layering.

I see the issue - the page is stuck in cache. Let me check the server configuration and add proper cache control headers to prevent this, and verify the data fetching is working correctly.

I'll remove all the mock data from the challenge detail page. Let me identify and remove: 1. Mock participant avatars (+12 mock count) 2. Hardcoded time remaining (02 Days, 14 Hours, 45 Mins) 3. The "View Timeline" button that doesn't work
