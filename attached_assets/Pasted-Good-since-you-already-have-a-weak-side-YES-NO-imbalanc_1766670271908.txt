Good — since you already have a weak-side (YES/NO imbalance) bonus, the goal now is to layer very simple, understandable bonus mechanics on top without turning Bantah into a sportsbook clone.

Below are plug-and-play bonus models that work with your existing YES/NO + auto-matching + admin control.

I’ll structure this cleanly so it’s usable by product, engineering, and growth.

⸻

1. Early Bird Bonus (Time-Based, Not Odds-Based)

What it is

Users who join earlier on either YES or NO get a multiplier or fixed bonus.

Why it works
 • Creates urgency
 • Rewards conviction
 • Not gambling-complex

Implementation

Admin sets:
 • earlyBirdSlots = 1000
 • earlyBirdBonus = +5% OR ₦X

Logic:

If userPosition <= earlyBirdSlots:
  apply earlyBirdBonus

Messaging
 • “First 1,000 picks get a bonus”
 • “Early opinions pay more”

⸻

2. Side Commitment Bonus (Anti-Flip Incentive)

What it is

Reward users who stay on one side until resolution.

Why it works
 • Reduces churn
 • Feels fair
 • Encourages confidence

Implementation

If user:
 • Joined YES or NO
 • Did not cancel / switch
 • Held stake until end

Then:
 • +X% bonus on winnings

Messaging
 • “Hold your position, earn extra”
 • “Conviction pays on Bantah”

⸻

3. Streak Bonus (Opinion Consistency)

What it is

Reward users for correct streaks across challenges.

Why it works
 • Adds skill identity
 • Builds retention
 • Not dependent on stake size

Simple model

Streak Bonus
2 wins +2%
5 wins +5%
10 wins +10%

Messaging
 • “On a hot streak 🔥?”
 • “Consistency = higher earnings”

⸻

4. Underdog Hero Bonus (Different from Weak Side Bonus)

You already bonus weak side when imbalance exists.

This version is outcome-based, not join-based.

What it is

If YES (or NO) had significantly fewer participants and wins, extra reward triggers.

Implementation

Admin sets:
 • underdogThreshold = <30% participation
 • underdogWinBonus = +X%

Messaging
 • “Back the unpopular opinion”
 • “Bold picks earn more”

⸻

5. Social Proof Bonus (Tag & Challenge)

What it is

Reward users for challenging/tagging another user.

Why it works
 • Drives virality
 • Makes tagging primary (your stated goal)

Implementation

If:
 • User creates challenge and tags another user
 • Match occurs

Then:
 • Both get small bonus (₦X or +%)

Messaging
 • “Challenge a friend. Both of you earn more.”
 • “Social challenges pay better.”

⸻

6. Admin Sponsored Bonus (Attention Magnet)

What it is

Admin injects bonus pool into specific challenges.

Why it works
 • Creates “featured” challenges
 • Drives mass participation
 • Easy to understand

Implementation

Admin dashboard:

Bonus Pool: ₦500,000
Distribution: Winners only / Pro-rata / Early joiners

Displayed on card:

“🔥 ₦500,000 Bonus Pool Active”

Messaging
 • “This challenge is boosted”
 • “Admin-backed challenge”

⸻

7. Accuracy Bonus (Skill > Capital)

What it is

Small bonus for users with high accuracy over time.

Why it works
 • Makes platform feel merit-based
 • Encourages small-stake users

Implementation

If:
 • Accuracy ≥ X%
 • Minimum challenges participated

Then:
 • +X% earnings boost

Messaging
 • “Top predictors earn more”
 • “Skill beats luck”

⸻

8. First-Time Join Bonus (Zero Friction Onboarding)

What it is

First YES or NO participation gets a boost.

Why it works
 • Reduces hesitation
 • Converts non-bettors

Implementation

If user.challengeCount == 1
 • Bonus applies automatically

Messaging
 • “Your first opinion earns extra”
 • “Try once, earn more”

⸻

9. Resolution Speed Bonus (Admin-Controlled)

What it is

Admin rewards challenges resolved quickly & cleanly.

Why it works
 • Builds trust
 • Encourages fast cycles

Implementation

If challenge resolved within X hours of dueDate:
 • Bonus triggers

Messaging
 • “Fast results, instant rewards”

⸻

10. Simple Bonus Stack Rule (Very Important)

To avoid confusion:

Rule

Only 2–3 bonuses can stack per challenge

Example:
 • Early Bird ✅
 • Weak Side ✅
 • Streak ❌ (disabled for that challenge)

Admin controls via toggle.
